# social-media
This is a simple social media application that uses a mern stack with the addition of graphql. The initial purpose of this application is to work on my skills using mongodb, react, express, node, and learn graphql.

If I can think of something that would make this app unique and I think it can provide value, I may add more features down the road, but for now this is going to be a Twitter clone for lack of better terminology
